How to Set Up SSH and Console Passwords
Securing access to your Cisco switches and routers is one of the first and most important tasks when deploying network devices. This article guides you through the step-by-step process of setting up both SSH (Secure Shell) and Console passwords to help protect your infrastructure from unauthorized access.



🔐 Why Secure Console and SSH Access?
Console access provides direct management via a physical connection.

SSH access allows for encrypted remote administration over the network.

Without proper passwords and encryption in place, your network could be vulnerable to intrusion, misconfiguration, or even a complete takeover.

Step 1: Configure the Domain Name
SSH requires a domain name for key generation.

Switch> enable
Switch# configure terminal
Switch(config)# ip domain-name example.com
Step 2: Create a Local User Account
This account will be used to authenticate SSH sessions.

Switch(config)# username admin privilege 15 secret MySecurePassword
secret encrypts the password. Avoid using password in production environments.

Step 3: Enable SSH and Generate Crypto Keys
Switch(config)# crypto key generate rsa
When prompted, choose a key size of at least 2048 bits for better security.

Now, enable the SSH version:

Switch(config)# ip ssh version 2
Step 4: Configure the VTY (Virtual Terminal) Lines for SSH Access
Switch(config)# line vty 0 4
Switch(config-line)# transport input ssh
Switch(config-line)# login local
Switch(config-line)# exit
This limits remote access to SSH only and uses local user credentials.

Step 5: (Optional but Recommended) Disable Telnet
To ensure that Telnet isn’t used as a fallback (since it's insecure):

Switch(config)# line vty 0 4
Switch(config-line)# transport input ssh
Or you can combine multiple protocols if needed:

transport input ssh telnet
But ideally, use SSH only.

Step 6: Set the Console Line Password
This secures physical access to the device via a console cable.

Switch(config)# line console 0
Switch(config-line)# password ConsolePass123
Switch(config-line)# login
Switch(config-line)# exit
Without the login command, the password won’t be prompted.

Step 7: Save Your Configuration
Always save your configuration to ensure it persists after a reboot:

Switch# write memory
✅ Test Your Setup
Try accessing the device via SSH using a tool like PuTTY or ssh command:

ssh admin@<device-ip>
Verify that Telnet is rejected (if disabled).

Physically connect via the console port and confirm the password prompt.

Final Thoughts
By configuring SSH and console passwords, you're taking foundational steps to secure your Cisco infrastructure. Always pair these methods with additional best practices like:

Using access control lists (ACLs)

Configuring AAA with RADIUS/TACACS+

Logging and monitoring remote access attempts

Security is a layered approach—these are the basics, but every layer counts.
