This article explores the features, benefits, and usage of Cisco Business Dashboard, demonstrating how it can transform your network management experience.

What is Cisco Business Dashboard?
Cisco Business Dashboard is a centralized management platform that provides an intuitive interface for monitoring, configuring, and managing Cisco Business network devices. This tool is specifically designed to cater to the needs of small and medium-sized businesses, offering comprehensive visibility and control over network infrastructure from a single pane of glass.

Key Features of Cisco Business Dashboard
Unified Management Interface:

The dashboard consolidates the management of all Cisco Business devices, including switches, routers, and wireless access points, into a single interface. This unified view simplifies network management tasks and reduces the complexity associated with handling multiple devices separately.

Network Monitoring and Alerts:

Cisco Business Dashboard provides real-time monitoring of network performance, health, and connectivity. It offers customizable alerts and notifications for various network events, enabling administrators to quickly identify and address issues before they impact business operations.

Automated Configuration and Deployment:

The dashboard streamlines device configuration and deployment with automated processes. You can apply consistent settings across multiple devices, ensuring uniformity and reducing the likelihood of configuration errors. This feature is particularly useful for scaling network infrastructure as your business grows.

Intuitive Reporting and Analytics:

Comprehensive reporting and analytics capabilities allow you to gain insights into network usage, performance trends, and potential bottlenecks. These insights help in making informed decisions to optimize network performance and plan for future expansions.

Security Management:

Ensuring network security is a top priority, and Cisco Business Dashboard offers robust security management features. You can easily configure security policies, monitor threats, and ensure compliance with industry standards. The dashboard provides visibility into security events, enabling prompt responses to potential threats.

Remote Management:

The ability to manage your network remotely is crucial, especially in today's flexible work environment. Cisco Business Dashboard allows you to monitor and configure your network from anywhere, providing the flexibility needed to support remote work and multiple business locations.

Licensing


Cisco Business Dashboard is licensed based on the number of infrastructure devices in your network. Licenses are required only for the Cisco Business and Cisco Small Business products in your network. Device licenses are required for using Cisco Business Dashboard, and integration licenses are required when Cisco Business Dashboard is being used with third-party applications such as Remote Monitoring and Management (RMM) tools. An instance of Cisco Business Dashboard includes 25 device licenses free of charge. If you have more than 25 devices, Cisco Business Dashboard will run in evaluation mode for up to 90 days while offering full functionality. Once you have finished your evaluation and if you have more than 25 devices in the network, you must obtain licenses for each additional Cisco Business or Cisco Small Business device in your network in excess of 25. Cisco Business Dashboard uses Cisco Smart Licensing and Cisco Smart Accounts for license management.
