IoT Specific Devices
Alongside the traditional networking equipment like routers and switches, Cisco Packet Tracer 8.2 introduces a wide range of IoT-specific devices in the Components Box.

These are divided into two main groups:

Smart Things
Smart Things are network-enabled devices — they can connect directly to a Home Gateway or Registration Server. These represent real-world smart objects and are grouped into four categories:

Home (e.g., smart TVs, lights)

Smart City

Industrial

Power Grid

Components
Components are non-networked physical elements that connect to either a Microcontroller (MCU-PT) or a Single Board Computer (SBC-PT). These devices don’t have direct network access and instead rely on their controller to send and receive data. They interact through digital or analog input/output pins.

Components fall into three categories:

Boards – These include microcontrollers, SBCs, and a special device called “Thing,” used to build custom smart devices like coffee machines or alarms.

Actuators – Devices that perform actions or affect the environment (like motors, buzzers, or smart doors).

Sensors – Devices that detect physical conditions (like light, temperature, motion, or user input through buttons or knobs).

This structure allows you to build realistic IoT setups, connecting sensors and actuators to controllers — just like in real-world smart systems.
