How to Create Your Own IoT Thing in Packet Tracer
In this activity, you'll design your own custom IoT device — a Security Camera — and add it to your simulated network in Cisco Packet Tracer.

Part 1: Create the Thing
Open Cisco Packet Tracer

Add a new Thing to the workspace (Components > Boards > Thing):

Go to the "Thing" category in the device selection box.

Drag a generic Thing onto the workspace.

Rename the device:

Open the device config window.

Go to Config > Global Settings.

Change the Display Name to Security Camera.

Edit the device properties:

Click Advanced > Thing Editor > Properties.

Rename the Component Name to Security Camera.

Set the Slot Mapping to Digital, and use **Slot 1`.

Click New to upload a custom image (e.g. a security camera icon) as the device's icon.

Part 2: Add to the Network
Add a network adapter:

Go to Advanced > I/O Config.

Set the network adapter to PT-IOT-NM-1CFE for wired, or PT-IOT-NM-1W for wireless.

Connect to the network:

Use a Copper Straight-Through cable to connect the device to the Wireless Router's Ethernet port.

Enable DHCP:

Go back to Config > FastEthernet0.

Set IP configuration to DHCP so it gets an IP address automatically.

Your custom Security Camera is now part of your IoT simulation!
