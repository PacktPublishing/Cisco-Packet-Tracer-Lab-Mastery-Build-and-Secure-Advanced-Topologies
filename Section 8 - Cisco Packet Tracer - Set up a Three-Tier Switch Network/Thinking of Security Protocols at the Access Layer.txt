Thinking of Security Protocols at the Access Layer
In a well-designed three-tier switch architecture, the Access Layer forms the first line of defense in your enterprise network. This is the layer where end-user devices — like PCs, printers, IP phones, and IoT devices — connect. As such, it's also the layer most vulnerable to internal threats, misconfigurations, or unauthorized access.

While the core and distribution layers focus on routing, policy, and high-speed forwarding, the access layer is where security must be tightly enforced. Let’s explore the key security implementations that should be in place at this layer.







🧱 1. Port Security
Port Security is a fundamental feature to restrict which MAC addresses are allowed on a given switch port.

🔧 How it works:
You can specify a maximum number of MAC addresses per port.

Optionally, lock a specific MAC address to that port.

If a rogue device is plugged in, the port can shut down, restrict, or protect based on configuration.

✅ Why it matters:
Prevents unauthorized devices from connecting.

Helps mitigate MAC flooding attacks and switch CAM table overflows.







🎭 2. 802.1X Port-Based Authentication
802.1X enforces user or device authentication before granting access to the network.

🔧 How it works:
Integrates with RADIUS servers like Cisco ISE.

Only authenticated users/devices are placed onto the network.

Supports dynamic VLAN assignment and posture assessment.

✅ Why it matters:
Ensures only authorized users can connect.

Helps enforce identity-based policies right at the port level.







🚫 3. Unused Port Shutdown
Every unused access port should be administratively shut down.

🔧 Configuration:
interface range fa0/10 - 24
 shutdown
✅ Why it matters:
Prevents rogue access through unmonitored ports.

Makes switch security more predictable and easier to manage.







🔐 4. DHCP Snooping
DHCP Snooping protects the network from rogue DHCP servers handing out malicious IP configurations.

🔧 How it works:
Allows DHCP responses only from trusted ports (e.g., uplinks to DHCP server).

Builds a table of legitimate IP-to-MAC-to-Port bindings.

✅ Why it matters:
Blocks man-in-the-middle attacks via rogue DHCP.

Works in conjunction with IP Source Guard and Dynamic ARP Inspection.







🧩 5. Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI)
DAI helps prevent ARP spoofing and poisoning by validating ARP packets against the DHCP snooping table.

🔧 How it works:
Only allows ARP replies with matching MAC-IP-Port combinations.

Invalid packets are dropped.

✅ Why it matters:
Mitigates ARP-based MITM attacks.

Prevents devices from impersonating gateways or other hosts.







🧼 6. BPDU Guard
BPDU Guard protects against unauthorized switches being plugged into access ports.

🔧 How it works:
If a Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) is received on a port configured for end devices, the port is shut down.

✅ Why it matters:
Prevents spanning-tree manipulation.

Stops users from accidentally or maliciously adding switches that could affect topology.







🚦 7. Storm Control
Storm Control limits the bandwidth used by broadcast, multicast, or unicast traffic on an interface.

✅ Why it matters:
Prevents broadcast storms that can cripple a segment.

Protects switch CPU and memory from being overwhelmed.







🛡️ 8. Private VLAN Edge (Protected Ports)
This feature isolates ports at Layer 2 even if they’re on the same VLAN.

🔧 Use case:
Devices like student PCs, printers, or IoT devices that shouldn’t talk to each other directly.

Still able to reach the gateway or uplink.

✅ Why it matters:
Prevents host-to-host traffic in shared VLANs.

Reduces lateral movement for threats like malware.







👁️ 9. ACLs on VLAN Interfaces
Even at the access layer, you can apply access control lists (ACLs) to limit traffic going into or out of VLANs.

✅ Why it matters:
Provides granular control on which subnets or services users can access.

Blocks unauthorized access to critical internal systems
